<h1><strong>Photo Guidelines</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking photographs is a scientific art which emerges out of the true emotions of the place and time of capture. Here are some tips which can help you in becoming one of the best Soku photographers possible.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lighting and framing! </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it pretty. People love pretty things.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Originality! </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upload your photos, not somebody else's.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keep it appropriate. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though nudity is natural, not everyone wants to see it. The same goes for hateful things, spam, and irrelevant photos. So steer away from naked people, mean-ness, gross-ness, inappropriate-ness and anything else that you wouldn't want to see when you're exploring.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Be respectful. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t take photos that include people's private information, like a credit card number or phone number, and don't upload a photo of anyone who doesn't want their picture uploaded. Think twice: you wouldn't want your private info shared either.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Be yourself. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soku is a community of people, and you're a big part of that. Take photos and have fun.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Be Cautious: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not upload images of places of high security and importance, archaeological sites, railways, defence areas, etc. without prior compliance with applicable laws from the concerned government authorities and departments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks and happy photographing!</span></p>
